## Tool Preferences

**IMPORTANT**: When working with GitHub operations (issues, pull requests, checks, releases, etc.):

- **ALWAYS use GitHub CLI (`gh`) via the Bash tool** for all GitHub-related tasks
- **DO NOT use MCP servers** for GitHub operations
- Examples: `gh pr create`, `gh issue list`, `gh pr view`, `gh api`, etc.
- The GitHub CLI provides more reliable and direct access to GitHub functionality
